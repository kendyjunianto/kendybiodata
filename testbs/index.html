			<div class="col-sm-6"><p>My full name is Kendy Junianto my friend used to call me Kenn or Candy. I was born in Sungai Rangsang 1 June 2002. I started studying in elementary school in 2007 right when I was 5,because in my town there was no kindergarten so I immediately started elementary school. After 6 years, I moved to Selat Panjang to start my junior high school in 2013, for one year I attended in Selatpanjang, i moved to Batam to continue the remaining 2 years of my junior high school in Batam in 2014, because we moved to batam at my second year of junior high school. </p></div>
		

			<div class="col-sm-6"><p>After finishing junior high school, I continued my high school at Ananda School, there I also met many new friends and they were also very friendly. In 2018 I was asked by my teacher to edit posters and edit videos, I had no basic knowledge of multimedia, so I tried to do the work and the results were also very good, after that my teacher took me to compete in the Computer Olympiad. And of course I did not win because I also still did not understand at all with multimedia. After graduate from high school, i went to batam international university and majored in Information System</p></div>
